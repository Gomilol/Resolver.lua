# Resolver.lua
Resolver for skeet. Made by Gomi, Warped and xSovietDoggo (he helped with angles but nothing else like pasting shit from fourms)
### Info

* This was NOT PAID. This was gave out to friends and a place holder for other fourm scripts, and shit I found cool.


* Also, I didn't attempt to grab IP's with this. I grab HTTP a total of 2 or 3 times. Anyone that says that is stupid and can't read simple lua. **cough cough bassn**



### Things to add:

* Make a logic resolver by grabbing delta and what ever that delta is invert that and you should have there real angle.


### Note:

* This has 0 logic meaning it's fucking dogshit. I would just recommend using the default skeet resolver.
